Secure and Monitored Web Infrastructure: A Fortress for Your Website

This design prioritizes security, monitoring, and encrypted traffic for a robust 3-server web infrastructure.

Adding Layers of Protection

    Firewalls: These act as security guards, filtering incoming traffic and blocking unauthorized access to the internal network (web servers) from the external world.
    SSL Certificates: Imagine a secure tunnel for data. SSL certificates encrypt communication between web servers and users, preventing eavesdropping and data breaches. This ensures:
        Privacy: Only authorized users can access information.
        Integrity: Data remains unaltered during transmission.
        Identification: Users can verify they're communicating with the legitimate website.

Keeping an Eye on Things

    Monitoring Clients: These act as watchful guardians, constantly analyzing server performance and overall health. They alert administrators if anything deviates from normal behavior. Think of them as providing real-time insights into server operations:
        Server accessibility
        Response times
        File integrity
        Security vulnerabilities
        And much more!

Areas for Improvement

While secure, there's always room for enhancement:

    SSL Termination: Currently, encryption only covers traffic between the internet and the load balancer. We can improve by extending encryption to the communication between the load balancer and web servers.
    Database Scalability: A single MySQL server poses a bottleneck. We can explore solutions like database clusters for better scalability and redundancy.
    Resource Competition: Having all components on the same servers can lead to performance issues. Separating components (web server, application server, database) across dedicated servers allows for better resource allocation and easier troubleshooting. Additionally, this approach improves scalability as individual components can be scaled independently.
