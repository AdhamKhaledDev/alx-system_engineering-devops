Simple Web Infrastructure for foobar.com

This write-up describes a basic web infrastructure for the website www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed]. It lacks security features like firewalls and SSL certificates. All components (database, application server) share the server's resources (CPU, RAM, and storage).

Understanding the Components

    Server: A computer dedicated to serving resources to other machines (clients) like your personal computer.
    Domain Name: A user-friendly name for an IP address. Think "www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed]" instead of memorizing a string of numbers. Domain names are translated to IP addresses by the Domain Name System (DNS).
    DNS Record (A Record): This record maps the domain name "www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed]" in this case to its corresponding IP address. You can check this record type using the dig command.
    Web Server: Software that receives requests from users' browsers (using HTTP or HTTPS) and delivers the requested content or error messages.
    Application Server: Software that manages and delivers applications to users and organizations.
    Database: A system for storing, organizing, and managing information that can be easily accessed and updated.

Communication:

The client (user's computer) and server communicate using the TCP/IP protocol over the internet.

Drawbacks of this Infrastructure

    Single Points of Failure (SPOF): If any component, like the database server, fails, the entire website goes down.
    Maintenance Downtime: Any maintenance on a component requires shutting it down, leading to website downtime.
    Limited Scalability: The single server can become overwhelmed by high traffic, causing slowdowns or outages. It's difficult to scale this infrastructure as adding more resources requires additional servers.
