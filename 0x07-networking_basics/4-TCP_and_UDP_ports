# Script to display listening ports, PIDs, and program names

# Use ss command instead of netstat, as it's generally considered a better alternative
# Use the 'tnlp' flags to show TCP and UDP listening sockets, ports, and process IDs
# Use 'cut' to extract relevant columns (PID and program name) from the output
ss -tnlp | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $4, $7}'

# Explaination of commands used
# - ss        : Replaces netstat (preferred for newer systems)
# - tnlp     : Shows TCP (t), UDP (n), listening (l) sockets, ports (p)
# - grep LISTEN : Filters output to show only listening sockets
# - awk '{print $4, $7}' : Prints the 4th and 7th columns (PID and program name)
