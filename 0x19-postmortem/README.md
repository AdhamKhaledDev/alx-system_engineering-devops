## The Day Our Database Went on a Memory Diet

**The Problem:**  On June 2nd, 2024, our online banking platform went on a 2.5-hour "vacation" from 2:15 PM to 4:45 PM EST.  68% of our users couldn't access their accounts or make transactions.  The culprit?  A sneaky memory leak in our database server, causing it to gobble up all the memory like a hungry monster.

**The Timeline:**

* **2:13 PM EST:**  Our monitoring system saw the database server's CPU and memory usage skyrocketing like a rocket ship.  We got an alert, but we didn't know it was about to get wild.
* **2:15 PM EST:**  The on-call engineer investigated and found the database server had gone AWOL.  Our platform was down, and our users were starting to panic.
* **2:20 PM EST:**  The engineering team jumped in, analyzing logs and metrics.  We thought it was a DDoS attack or a configuration issue, but the real culprit was hiding in plain sight...
* **2:45 PM EST:**  We discovered a memory leak in the database application, like a tiny bug eating away at our server's memory.  It was a real "memory hog!"
* **3:00 PM EST:**  We called in the big guns – senior engineering leadership – and activated the incident response plan.  It was time to get serious.
* **3:15 PM EST:**  We backed up the database and started migrating user traffic to a backup server.  It was a race against time!
* **4:00 PM EST:**  The migration was complete, and we started bringing the platform back online, piece by piece.
* **4:45 PM EST:**  Full service was restored!  We were back in business, but the investigation continued.

**The Fix:**

We found the bug in the database management software that was causing the memory leak.  We patched it up, and our server was back to its normal, healthy self.  We also implemented some new measures to prevent this from happening again:

* **Memory Monitoring on Steroids:**  We're now keeping a close eye on all our database servers' memory usage, so we can catch any memory leaks before they become a problem.
* **Code Review Bootcamp:**  We're giving our database application code a thorough review to find any other potential memory leaks or performance bottlenecks.
* **Incident Response Playbook Upgrade:**  We're beefing up our incident response playbook to handle database outages more effectively, including seamless failover to backup servers.
* **Database Performance Training:**  We're giving our engineering team a crash course in database performance optimization and troubleshooting.
* **Automated Load Testing and Chaos Engineering:**  We're testing the limits of our platform to identify and fix any weaknesses before they cause problems.

We've learned our lesson:  Database servers need a healthy diet, and we're making sure they get it.  We're also making sure we're ready for anything, so our online banking platform can stay up and running smoothly for our users.
